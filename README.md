# The Smart Report

## Introduction

Many people today obsessively check the news. They rotate between websites and doomscroll on Twitter. Some people try to escape the cycle by performing a "digital purge." But this can disconnect them from the news entirely. There needs to be something in between the endless checking of sites and tossing out one's phone.

Our solution is to provide a service that aggregates an individual's favorite news sources into a short newsletter delivered by email daily or weekly. This would give people a way to control how often they check the news, and save them time spent flipping between websites. Users would be able to opt-in to machine learning which would tailor which stories are sent to them based on what kind of stories they click on.
